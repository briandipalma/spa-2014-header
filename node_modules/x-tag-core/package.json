  "readme": "# X-Tag - Custom Elements for Modern Browsers\n\n**Current version: 0.9.4**\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/x-tag/core.png)](https://travis-ci.org/x-tag/core)\n\n[![Selenium Test Status](https://saucelabs.com/browser-matrix/aschaar.svg)](https://saucelabs.com/u/aschaar)\n\n**This is the repository for the core [X-Tag](http://x-tags.org) library.**\n\nBased on the current W3 Web Components [draft][1], X-Tag enables the custom element portion of the proposal.\nCustom elements let you register new tags/elements with the parser, so they are recognized and inflated with\nspecial abilities you define.\n\nYou can find out more about what X-Tag does, where it works, and how to use it, on the project page: [http://x-tags.org](http://x-tags.org).\n\nX-Tag (excluding third-party icons or images) is subject to the terms of the Mozilla Public License, v. 2.0. If a copy of the MPL was not distributed with this file, You can obtain one at http://mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/.\n\n  [1]: https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/webcomponents/raw-file/tip/explainer/index.html       \"W3 Web Components Spec (Draft)\"\n\n## Getting started\n\nTo get started hacking on X-Tag core:\n\n````bash\ngit clone https://github.com/x-tag/core x-tag-core --recursive\ncd x-tag-core\nnpm install     # installs all the required dependencies using package.json\ngrunt polyfill  # rebuilds polyfill file\ngrunt build     # outputs x-tag-core.js and x-tag-core.min.js to ./dist\n````\n\nIf you are interested in building your own custom elements, you can use our [web-component-stub](https://github.com/x-tag/web-component-stub) as a starting point.\n\n## Updating\n\nIf you already have cloned the library and want to update to the latest changes, do:\n\n````bash\ncd x-tag-core\ngit pull origin master\ngit submodule update\nnpm install\ngrunt polyfill\ngrunt build\n````\n\nThis assumes you just cloned the library and its remote repository is labelled `origin`. Suppose you had your own fork where your own remote is `origin`; you should add another remote origin and label it as `upstream`. Then your `git pull` line would need to be `git pull upstream master` instead.\n\n## Tests\n\nJasmine tests via grunt are not working yet, please open [test/index.html](test/index.html) in your browser to see if everything passes.\n\n\n## Regenerating the distributable build\n\nIn the interest of not reinventing the wheel, X-Tag core uses a few existing libraries which get pulled into the project. But distributing a bunch of separate files is not efficient, so we need to generate a single file that contains all this code.\n\nIf you make changes on the library and want to regenerate the build, just run\n\n````bash\ngrunt build\n````\n\nand both `x-tag-core.js` and `x-tag-core.min.js` will be rebuilt and placed in the `./dist` directory.\n\n\n## Creating your own web components\n\nTo learn more about X-Tags visit [x-tags.org](http://x-tags.org).\n\nTo create your own component, use our [web-component-stub](https://github.com/x-tag/web-component-stub).\n\nShare your components by adding them to the [Custom Elements Registry](http://customelements.io/) or Bower.\n",
